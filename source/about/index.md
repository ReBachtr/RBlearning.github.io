I am a Master's student at University of California San Diego, majoring in Machine learning and data science. Graduating in 2020, looking for software engineer position. 

### Work Experience

**Nullmax** (2019.06 - 2019.09, Shanghai, China)

***Machine learning engineer intern***

> Responsible for the deep learning algorithm application and research.
>
> Responsible for a project achieving a visual solution for self-driving end to end control. To predict the steering command of the car on-road only depends on cameras and map images. Construct a variational network based on CNN as an ensemble model with a novel loss function. Show the end to end learning potential in a real-world application, and got a well and applicable result.
>
> Use OpenCV, OpenStreetMap, and Kalman Filter in the project, and be familiar with detective model such as YOLO.
